HEALTH AND RELATED ISSUES
Health
The world is a difficult place to be in sometimes. These were some inspiring stories of people who faced health problems or challenges, had a cool life experience, or underwent groundbreaking surgery, which made us feel a little bit better about being in this world.
It‚Äôs important to take care of both your mind and body. It will pay off in many ways, including:

Allowing you to take charge of your life and feel good about the choices you make.

Gaining energy and feeling more fit.

Improving your physical health.

Gaining a positive outlook and finding more enjoyment in your life.

Being a role model for your family and friends.
Any lifestyle change is a ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Lasting changes take time. So, begin by setting small goals that are easy to add to your daily life and that you control. Wellness and fitness involve being aware and making healthy choices about diet, exercise, and staying positive. This is the most important investment you can make in your life. Strive for the best health you can have in all areas of your life by making mindful, healthy choices

COMMON HEALTH ISSUES

Physical Activity and Nutrition
Research indicates that staying physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including some cancers, heart disease and diabetes, and also relieve depression and improve mood. Inactivity often accompanies advancing age, but it doesn't have to. Check with your local churches or synagogues, senior centers, and shopping malls for exercise and walking programs. Like exercise, your eating habits are often not good if you live and eat alone. It's important for successful aging to eat foods rich in nutrients and avoid the empty calories in candy and sweets.
Overweight and Obesity
Being overweight or obese increases your chances of dying from hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, dyslipidemia and endometrial, breast, prostate, and colon cancers. In-depth guides and practical advice about obesity are available from the¬†National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health
Tobacco
Tobacco is the single greatest preventable cause of illness and premature death in the U.S. Tobacco use is now called "Tobacco dependence disease." The¬†Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)¬†says that smokers who try to quit are more successful when they have the support of their physician.
Substance Abuse
Substance abuse usually means drugs and alcohol. These are two areas we don't often associate with seniors, but seniors, like young people, may self-medicate using legal and illegal drugs and alcohol, which can lead to serious health consequences. In addition, seniors may deliberately or unknowingly mix medications and use alcohol. Because of our stereotypes about senior citizens, many medical people fail to ask seniors about possible substance abuse.
HIV/AIDS
Between 11 and 15% of U.S. AIDS cases occur in seniors over age 50. Between 1991 and 1996, AIDS in adults over 50 rose more than twice as fast as in younger adults. Seniors are unlikely to use condoms, have immune systems that naturally weaken with age, and HIV symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, dementia, skin rashes, swollen lymph nodes) are similar to symptoms that can accompany old age. Again, stereotypes about aging in terms of sexual activity and drug use keep this problem largely unrecognized. That's why seniors are not well represented in research, clinical drug trials, prevention programs and efforts at intervention.
Mental Health
Dementia is not part of aging. Dementia can be caused by disease, reactions to medications, vision and hearing problems, infections, nutritional imbalances, diabetes, and renal failure. There are many forms of dementia (including Alzheimer's Disease) and some can be temporary. With accurate diagnosis comes management and help. The most common late-in-life mental health condition is depression. If left untreated, depression in the elderly can lead to suicide. Here's a surprising fact:
The rate of suicide is higher for elderly white men than for any other age group, including adolescents
Injury and Violence
Among seniors, falls are the leading cause of injuries, hospital admissions for trauma, and deaths due to injury. One in every three seniors (age 65 and older) will fall each year. Strategies to reduce injury include exercises to improve balance and strength and medication review.¬†Home modifications¬†can help reduce injury. Home security is needed to prevent intrusion. Home-based fire prevention devices should be in place and easy to use. People aged 65 and older are twice as likely to die in a home fire as the general population.
Environmental Quality
Even though pollution affects all of us, government studies have indicated that low-income, racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in areas where they face environmental risks. Compared to the general population, a higher proportion of elderly are living just over the poverty threshold
Immunization
Influenza and pneumonia and are among the top 10 causes of death for older adults. Emphasis on Influenza vaccination for seniors has helped. Pneumonia remains one of the most serious infections, especially among women and the very old.
Access to Health Care
Seniors frequently don't monitor their health as seriously as they should. While a shortage of geriatricians has been noted nationwide, URMC has one of the largest groups of geriatricians and geriatric specialists of any medical community in the country. Your access to health care is as close as URMC, offering a menu of services at several hospital settings, including the VA Hospital in Canandaigua, in senior housing, and in¬†your¬†community.

Causes of health problems: certain and uncertain

Dealing with any illness can be easier when the reason for it is understood. Health problems can be caused by a person‚Äôs genetic make-up, lifestyle behaviours (e.g. smoking), exposure to toxic substances (e.g. asbestos) or other reasons. With multiple health problems, one illness or its treatment might lead to another. ¬†The reason for a disease might become clear after a long period of uncertainty, perhaps involving a large number of tests and investigations or being referred to many different health professionals. Sometimes people never know why they have one or more illnesses. If a medical reason cannot be found, then a person might form their own ideas, such as it bein‚Ä¶
[10:13 PM, 10/22/2021] +234 708 037 4413: How to Solve Healthcare Problems with Technology?

There are several problems that the healthcare sector faces every day. However, technology can help you stay ahead of the curve and lend a hand at placing you among the top technological healthcare providers.

Here are some of the primary healthcare problems that technology can solve for a better and healthier world:

Ôøº

Problem 1: No Remote Access

Healthcare has been associated with in-person consultations for decades. This has been a problem that obligates the patients to run to the nearest healthcare center for treatment.

Now, the¬†COVID¬†outbreak and lockdowns made it even worse. The contagion effect of the virus restrained people in the four walls of their homes. So, what do they do if they need to see a doctor and have an emergency?

The need for remote access or virtual consultations is the need of the hour, which needs to be taken care of to stay one step ahead in the technology adoption race.

Solution 1: Invest in healthcare mobile and web applications

Mobile app developers¬†continue to grow the flexibility and performance abilities of these remote-oriented platforms. This creates a reliable experience for medical experts to provide quality care and advice to patients from miles away.

With¬†mobile healthcare solutions, telemedicine aims to raise the level of healthcare with wearables and smartphones to track health. The use of technology in healthcare has accelerated the development of products that experiment with technology such as holography, artificial intelligence, and¬†machine learning,¬†augmented, and virtual reality.
Problem 2: Existing Siloes in the Healthcare World

The healthcare professionals in the world are disconnected and are seen to be working in silos. There is a missing platform that can bring the healthcare industry on a single page, where they can discuss their learning and share knowledge, and create notes.

If there were a single platform exclusively for the healthcare sector ‚Äî things could get better. Everyone can learn from everyone, leading to a better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment.

Solution 2: Social Networking App for Healthcare Professionals

Building a¬†social networking app¬†exclusively for healthcare professions can solve the problem at hand. Something like what Net Solutions did by creating ‚ÄúThe OCR‚Äù (The On Call Room) ‚Äî the mobile social platform for healthcare professionals.

The app covers:

The latest development of the healthcare industry

Ability to share photos, PDFs, PPTs, excel sheets, and videos

Ability to post new status and ability to like and comment and ask questions

Ability to share patient data among healthcare professionals
The solution is viable and makes for a solution that helps create a healthier and better world by enabling collaboration and communication in the sector. Sharing knowledge can help solve health problems together while promoting inclusivity.

Problem 3: Issues with Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement

Medicare and Medicaid are government healthcare programs that provide healthcare coverages to patients. Their repayment structures vary significantly and need to maintain an orchestrated management process.¬†The procedures for filing and receiving Medicare and Medicaid are very different and are an extra task on the to-do list of healthcare professionals. The regulations also need them to store and record patient records in a particular format for the services rendered.

Whenever treatment is availed under Medicare, the doctors need to fill out the prescribed electronic forms as proof that the patient has, in fact, received the healthcare service. The rules and regulations have made it mandatory for healthcare pros to follow the process to get paid, adding significantly to the problems.

Solution 3: Invest in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR System

Healthcare reform has been one of the most disruptive political issues right now. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are one of those healthcare technology trends that the industry is ready to embrace to simplify health record-keeping and Medicare and Medicaid filing.

EHRs offer an apolitical tool to control health care expenditure, which is expected to grow at 5.8% until 2022.
EHR systems facilitate appropriate electronic forms for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement from the government. It is easy for healthcare professionals to keep the patients‚Äô health records and fill out the forms for reimbursement when the service has been provided.

These systems also help improve the transaction of information from the doctors to the government and vice versa. They also standardize the format of information as needed by the government to disburse claims, apart from speeding up the submission of patient files and requesting payments for the services rendered.

Also, tracking the medical history of a patient online eases the headache of maintaining paper files. This way, doctors can focus more on their core functionalities and offer effective coordinate care with other doctors to plan cohesive, personalized treatment plans.

Problem 4: Absence of Supply Management System
As patients, we never think of the logistics that lie behind healthcare services. But they form the backbone of the industry. Efficient logistics practices ensure uninterrupted healthcare services. Managing these logistics is, still, a tricky task.

While it may sound more like a supply chain mismanagement problem, it creates troubles like mismanaged medical inventory and equipment or drug shortage at the backend. On the frontend, i.e., doctor‚Äôs end, it causes inefficiencies; on the patients‚Äô end, frustration and, of course, danger to their health.

Traditional supply chain management is often wasteful and inefficient. It leads to money wasted on lost and damaged inventory, improper delivery of equipment or medication, and the damage caused to patients due to all that amount to massive financial losses for healthcare services.

Supply shortages, misplaced inventory, and less than stellar preventative measures regarding shrinkage, all play into the reality that hospitals are epicenters for wasteful operations without a proper supply management system in place.

Solution 4: Invest in a Data Management Systems
To avoid heavy losses and to spend unnecessarily, it‚Äôs imperative to turn to digital healthcare technology providers for a powerful and effective solution.

Invest in an inventory management system, or a warehouse management system, if you may, to be at the higher end of supply chain management.

A strong data management system powered by data analytics is one that is not only constantly updated and operates within an easy-to-use graphic user interface (GUI), but also provides insightful and meaningful data.

This way, administrative and medical professionals alike have immediate access to accurate inventory numbers and current budget allocations.

Problem 5: Managing the Massive Volumes of Patient-Related Data
Patient-related data is one of the most overwhelming aspects of healthcare. With each new addition to the patient database, the existing pool of data becomes still bigger.

Consequently, it becomes even tougher to manage this data. As much as we may expect the existing traditional infrastructure to manage and secure the data, it is only an unrealistic expectation.

The storage and the retrieval of this patient data, when needed, is a challenge that the hospitals need to address. Data overload and mismanagement often lead to wrong diagnoses, compromise in data security, improper treatment, lapsed appointments, and failure to keep up with the changes in progress or regression of the patient‚Äôs condition, etc. The implications can be catastrophic for both doctors as well as patients.

Solution 5: Cloud + Data analytics Capabilities
The healthcare technology solution to this challenge lies in cloud-based data systems and mobile portals. These solutions provide healthcare professionals with real-time access to patient-related data like registrations, medical history, diagnoses, treatments, appointments, and more.

And since the storage and retrieval are cloud-based, the records are updated in real-time and appropriately secured.


The cloud-based products that can help you maintain a patient database are also handy options along with data analytics capabilities.

Healthcare mobile app development and integration of these systems with apps based on iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms provide even more flexibility for doctors and other practitioners that are on-the-go throughout their workday.

Here‚Äôs an example of technology in healthcare implementation ‚Äî we built the healthcare technology solution for EMR providers to improve their efficiency and outcome. EMR is a built-in decision support engine that helps healthcare staff speed up and automates diagnosing a disease. This helped not only patients but doctors and hospitals to increase reimbursements.

To know how we built an EMR with a built-in decision support engine and unique workflows, read the case study ‚Äì
Problem 6: Inefficiencies and Errors in Data Sharing
In an age where medical science has made noteworthy advancements, inefficiencies, and healthcare errors are still persistent because of low-key technology that the healthcare industry adopts for management.

This is not just a hurdle in the way of medical science; it causes regression because of the waste it generates. Not only do patients pay the price in the form of inconvenience and health, but we also see a rise in administrative expenses and litigation owing to these inefficiencies and errors.

One specific area of concern is the exchange of patient data in case of patient transfer from one department or one hospital to another. Patient record sharing, when done the traditional way, is not only time-consuming and inefficient but also exposes the patient information to the risk of a breach.

An incomplete or inefficient exchange of this data can prove to be dangerous in the case of patients in need of urgent or complicated treatment.

Solution 6: Blockchain-Based Database
To be able to deliver a holistic and satisfactory patient experience, different parties involved in healthcare ‚Äì doctors, healthcare scheme providers, insurance providers, doctors, and patients ‚Äì should be able to exchange information among themselves securely.

Using cloud-based data management systems can be one stable solution to solving the inefficiencies caused by the traditional pen-and-paper way of managing data.

The most up-and-coming solution to this healthcare management problem is the use of a blockchain-based database to store and share patient records. This healthcare technology trend can not only permit the quick and complete transfer of data but also eliminate insecurity, thus maintaining the privacy and integrity of patient information.

Problem 7: Lack of Online Pharmaceutical Stores
The increase in eCommerce stores across the web has changed the shopping habits of people. They want anything and everything available online. However, the lack of medicinal stores online is a problem that makes the industry lag when compared to other sectors.

Because the medicines sold online should be prescription-based, there is a lack of e-stores that can disrupt the market and can bring convenience to the consumers.

Solution 7: Setting up Prescription-based Online Medical Stores
The launch of an online pharmaceutical store should be on your list. There is a huge potential in the online market. However, you might not disrupt the market as Amazon (stereotyped for disruptions) has recently launched Amazon Pharmacy ‚Äî which offers home delivery for prescription-based medicines.

What you need to get started:

An eCommerce platform to get started ‚Äî Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, etc.
Developers ‚Äî for designing and creating a website and mobile app
Delivery management system ‚Äî for streamlining last-mile deliveries
What is the Future of Technology in Healthcare ‚Äî Bright!
There‚Äôs no denying that the healthcare industry has come a long way as technology continues to take on a role of prominence in this industry. From dealing with data overload across various institutions to connecting doctors and patients from opposite ends of the globe via mobile apps, healthcare technology continues to advance in the right direction.

We may presently be viewing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what mobile apps, cloud-based services, and other digital assets have to offer to healthcare professionals. Digital transformation in healthcare is expected to be seen more prominently in the coming times and will bring exciting opportunities in the industry for doctors as well as patients.

Let us bind technology and healthcare together!
